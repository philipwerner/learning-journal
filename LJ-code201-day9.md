# LJ code201 Day 9

After a very rough start on Monday....I have had a couple of really good days coding. Learning about constructors, tables and events has really clicked for me. It has felt really good being able to complete the labs in a timely matter. It has also been really cool being able to help classmates trouble shoot their code and getting more experience reading code and knowing what questions to ask them about there code to make more sense of their work.

I feel like I was able to come a long way on CSS styling today, I am usually way to eager to start making things look different and not take the time to plan. I thought back on my design school days and spent time visualizing and sketching out what I wanted, then researched different styles and ideas. I think today went really well and I was able to get a lot of work done. I also got Linter working, soooo that was pretty freaking cool.
