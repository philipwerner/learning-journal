# LJ code201 Day 8

After a very rough start on Monday....I have had a couple of really good days coding. Learning about constructors, tables and events has really clicked for me. It has felt really good being able to complete the labs in a timely matter. It has also been really cool being able to help classmates trouble shoot their code and getting more experience reading code and knowing what questions to ask them about there code to make more sense of their work. I am really looking forward to tomorrow!!!!
