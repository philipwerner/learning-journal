# Day 19!!!!

We finished up Fuzz Feed and launched it onto fuzzfeed.fun, everything is working great. It was really nice to see this come together and not to have any issues with the group, no one lost their cool or anything. I really need to work on keeping my CSS clean, it makes it really hard to go in and add or change stuff later on. I think I will work on this over the break and hopefully figure out my own format to keep it clean and easy to modify. This has been a great experience so far, I am really glad I am in this program and can't wait for 301.
