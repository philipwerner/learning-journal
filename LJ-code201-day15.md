# Learning Journal 201 Day 15

It has been an amazing 3 weeks, that is for sure. This past couple days were really fun. It was awesome working with Lola and learning from her, she is super good at this stuff and her brain is just going 90 all the time. I am really excited about working on this group project and making our own website from scratch and seeing it come together and be deployed on the web. Also can't wait for 301!!!!!
