# LJ Code 201 - Day 2

Today was pretty awesome. I have been struggling with the idea of javascript. I really think some of the tutorials I took didn't really help to get a feel for how to use it. But now that we have been using JS I am getting a feel for it. I am really excited to continue on and get a better understanding of more advanced JS. It is really nice looking forward to the next day of challenges and not having to worry about falling into the water.

I also had a bit of a click with JS later in the afternoon. It felt really good to actually write some JS and see it work. Then have it not work and to be able to trouble shoot is myself and have it work again. Today was a good day!
