# LJ Code 201 - Day 2

Today was pretty awesome. I have been struggling with the idea of javascript. I really think some of the tutorials I took didn't really help to get a feel for how to use it. But now that we have been using JS I am getting a feel for it. I am really excited to continue on and get a better understanding of more advanced JS. It is really nice looking forward to the next day of challenges and not having to worry about falling into the water.
