#LJ Code 301 Day 1

And so it begins!!! Today was a good start to the course, I liked how it wasn't insanely complicated stuff. I am really excited to learn all this new stuff. I am a little nervous about my recent switch to Mac after running on a Windows system last course. I think it will be a little bit of a hassle for the first week or so until I get back into the groove of using a mac.

I am feeling a lot more confident about my skills and where I am at compared to how I felt the first day or even week of 201. Really looking forward to this course and working with all the great people from 201 and our new few students.
