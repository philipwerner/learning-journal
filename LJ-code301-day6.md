Working with AJAX was pretty fun, although dealing with local storage again was like "OH NO!!". But it went pretty well, didn't have any real issues, other than a callback function on the wrong line in the lab, but once that was figured out it was all working right. Looking forward to learning more about AJAX and using it for more complicated things.
