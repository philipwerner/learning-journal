Heroku is easy enough as long as you know the secret URL...... Today was pretty simple to learn, just have to get used to the terminal commands. Yesterdays lab using APIs was also a pretty simple one and it is crazy how easy it is to work with APIs. I am looking forward to working more with APIs during project week.
