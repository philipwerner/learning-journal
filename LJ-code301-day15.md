# LJ code 301 day 15

This was a rough week. The portfolio kicked my butt, it was easy working on the Labs but getting everything to work in the portfolio did not go very well. I did learn a lot this week, and I need to spend some off time working on it and improve my skills. But in the end I am very happy with how I caught on to new stuff this week.
