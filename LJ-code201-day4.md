# LJ Code 201 Day 4
Four days in, I have become way more comfortable with JavaScript, I am now able to look at code and understand what it is doing!!
The day 3 lab was really frustrating because it turned out I just need to move a } up a couple of lines. But it was a really good learning experience. One thing that I am super excited and happy about is how comfortable and confident I feel using the terminal and git. When I used the terminal and Git in 101 I was very intimidated. So far this has been an awesome week and I feel like I have come a very long way!
