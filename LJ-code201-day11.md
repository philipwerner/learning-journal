# LJ code 201 Day 11

Well this was a rough one. Sometimes the javascript logic just really kicks my butt. Although I think struggling with it helps me to learn it when I see the right way to do it. I feel like I wrote and deleted like 5,000 lines of code today, which may be a little more than what I wrote, but it doesn't feel like it. When I did get a victory today it was pretty awesome. I am going to keep at it some more, just need a break to let my head clear before getting back to the grind.
